# 🧥 WTWR (What to Wear?) — Back End

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to the back-end of **WTWR (What to Wear?)** — the stylish server powering my full-stack app! 💻✨

Over the last two sprints, I built out the front end of WTWR 💅 — and now it’s time to get everything working behind the scenes. That means connecting to databases, setting up secure routes, and deploying it all like a pro. 😎

While working on this project, I'm learning how to:

- ✨ Set up a complete Express server  
- 🗄️ Create and connect a MongoDB database  
- 🛣️ Configure routes and controllers  
- 🚨 Handle errors the right way  
- 🧪 Add security and testing  
- ☁️ Deploy the app to a remote server

## 🚀 Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server 

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature
